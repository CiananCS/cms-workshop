    "Python is a widely used, open source programming language developed by Guido van Rossum. It was first released in 1991. Python is a great language for beginner programmers because it was designed with the newcomer in mind. Python was designed to be readable and it has a simple and consistent syntax. Additionally, Python has a very extensive section of mathematical and scientific libraries. These libraries contain code that has already been written to perform specific tasks so you just need to know how to call the library rather than write the code itself. Lastly, Python is free.\n",

Floating point numbers are ones where the number of figures to the right of the decimal varies based upon the value of the floating point number. If a whole number is written with no decimal point then Python treats it as an integer. If a number is written with a decimal point then Python treats it as a floating point number.

Variables cannot have spaces in their names so vanderWaals is an acceptable variable, but van der Walls is not. Variables are case-sensitive, so x is a different variable than X. There are a number of words, such as print, that Python has reserved for special purposes; you cannot name your variable any of these reserved words. You will know you have typed a reserved word because it will appear green in your Notebook. Once a variable is assigned a value, it retains that value throughout a session until it is changed, thus you can use it in other cells."

    "We got started on this endeavor of making arrays because we wanted to plot $y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ from $x = -5$ to $x = 5$. Python has a function, conveniently called plot, which makes 2-D plots. The basic syntax of the plot function is (x,y,formatstring). So the first argument is for the horizontal axis, the second argument is for the vertical axis, and the formatstring argument will let you format your plot. For instance, if you want red circle markers you would type 'ro'. The cell below plots $y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ from $x = -5$ to $x = 5$ as a magenta dash-dot line, and labels the x and y axes. Try it!  \n",

    "After you've plotted it, play around with the pan and zoom buttons. "

    "An array is its own class and consists of an ordered list of scalars. It is essentially a python matrix in that it has a specific rectangular form and is indexed like a matrix. However functions applied to it are applied piecewise, so that if $A$ = array([[0,1],[1,1]]), $A**2$ is still [[0 1];[1 1]] and not [[1 1];[1 2]]. And unlike a list, new terms cannot be added to an array after it is made. A scalar on the other hand is just a simple number, be it an integer, real, complex, etc.\n",
